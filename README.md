# Grid Vulnerability Index (GVI) Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the complete set of files and scripts used in the development of the Grid Vulnerability Index (GVI) to assess the vulnerability of the electrical power grid to various risks, particularly weather-related events. The project integrates data from multiple sources, including power plants, transmission lines, critical infrastructures, and real-time weather conditions.

## Structure
The repository is organized into multiple directories containing data files, scripts, and analysis notebooks. Key directories include:

- `all_power_plants`: Contains geojson files for various types of power plants.
- `QGIS`: Contains QGIS projects for visual analysis.
- `scorings`: Includes CSV files with scoring results for different grid components and resolutions.
- `usgs_infrastructures`: Contains geojson files for critical USGS infrastructures.
- `ny_state_shp`: Includes shapefiles for New York state and counties.

## Key Files
- `app.py`, `appp.py`, `dash_app.py`: Python scripts for web applications displaying the GVI.
- `National_Weather_Service_api.ipynb`: Notebook for fetching and analyzing real-time weather data.
- `all_generators.ipynb`, `geo_to_shp.ipynb`, `scoring_*.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks used for data processing and scoring the GVI.

## Usage
To run the Jupyter notebooks, ensure that you have Jupyter installed and launch the notebooks via Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab interface. Python scripts can be run directly from a Python environment or through any Python IDE.
